# TeamTailor to BambooHR Integration Fixes Summary

## Date: January 15, 2025

### Issues Fixed

1. **Removed Test Prefix and Test Email**
   - **Issue**: Script was adding "TEST_" prefix to employee names and using randomized test emails
   - **Fix**: Removed the TEST_ prefix and now uses the actual candidate email from TeamTailor
   - **Code**: Lines 293-295 in `teamtailor_bamboohr_integration.py`

2. **Fixed File Upload Failures**
   - **Issue**: All file uploads were failing with JSON parsing errors
   - **Fix**: Added proper error handling for non-JSON responses from BambooHR API
   - **Code**: Lines 675-694 - Added try/catch for JSON parsing with fallback handling

3. **Handled Unsupported File Extensions**
   - **Issue**: `.twbx` (Tableau) and `.pptx` (PowerPoint) files were rejected by BambooHR
   - **Fix**: Added `get_supported_filename()` method that appends `.pdf` to unsupported extensions
   - **Code**: Lines 606-627 - New method to convert unsupported filenames

4. **Improved Error Reporting**
   - **Issue**: Script reported overall success even when file uploads failed
   - **Fix**: Added partial success reporting that shows exactly how many files succeeded/failed
   - **Code**: Lines 769-800 - Added success rate calculation and partial success flag

5. **Added Duplicate Employee Handling**
   - **Issue**: 409 Conflict error when employee with same email already exists
   - **Fix**: Added `check_employee_exists()` method and generates unique test email if duplicate found
   - **Code**: Lines 497-541 - New method to check for existing employees

6. **Enhanced Logging**
   - **Issue**: Insufficient error details for debugging
   - **Fix**: Added detailed logging for API responses, file sizes, and error messages
   - **Code**: Multiple locations - Added print statements with status codes and response details

### Test Results
