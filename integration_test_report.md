# TeamTailor to BambooHR Integration Test Report

## Test Overview
**Date:** January 15, 2025  
**Payload Used:** `src/payload_for_test.json`  
**Candidate:** Iryna Munchak  
**Job:** Marketing Data Analyst (Job ID: 6065241)  

## Test Results Summary

### ✅ What Worked
1. **Employee Creation:** Successfully created employee in BambooHR
   - Employee ID: 301
   - Name: TEST_Iryna Munchak (TEST_ prefix added by script)
   - Email: test.uqyw1x@example.com (randomized test email)
   - Department: BI and Data Analytics Department
   - Job Title: Middle Marketing Data Analyst
   - BambooHR URL: https://viragames.bamboohr.com/employees/301

2. **Data Processing:**
   - ✅ Webhook payload validation passed
   - ✅ TeamTailor requisition retrieved successfully
   - ✅ Department information fetched correctly
   - ✅ 10 files downloaded from TeamTailor successfully
   - ✅ Employee payload built correctly
   - ✅ BambooHR meta fields validated

### ❌ What Failed
1. **Document Uploads:** All 10 file uploads to BambooHR failed
   - Files that failed:
     - final_project_lesnikova.twbx
     - _.pptx
     - anna_pylypchuk_certificate.pdf
     - cover_letter_vira_games.pdf
     - daria_shchipak.pdf
     - certificate_roman_vitovych.pdf
     - ivan_kutsenko_marketing_data_analyst_over_letter.pdf
     - associate_data_analyst_in_sql.pdf
     - data_analyst_in_tableau.pdf
     - taras_lebedyev.pdf
   
   - Error messages:
     - Some files: "Failed to upload file: " (empty error message)
     - Most files: "Error uploading file: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)"

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **File Upload Failure Despite Employee Creation Success**
The script reports overall success even when all file uploads fail. This is misleading because:
- The employee is created without their documents
- The success message doesn't indicate the file upload failures
- Users might think the process completed fully when it didn't

### 2. **Poor Error Handling for File Uploads**
- Empty error messages for some files
- JSON parsing errors ("Expecting value: line 1 column 1") suggest the API response isn't being handled correctly
- The script continues processing even after all uploads fail

### 3. **No Rollback Mechanism**
- When file uploads fail, the employee remains created in BambooHR
- No option to retry file uploads or rollback the employee creation

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. **Fix File Upload Issues**
```python
def upload_file_to_bamboohr(self, employee_id: int, file_path: str, 
                            filename: str, category: str = "16") -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Add better error handling
    try:
        response = self.bamboohr_session.post(url, files=files, data=data)
        
        # Check content type before parsing JSON
        if response.status_code == 201:
            try:
                json_response = response.json() if response.content else {}
                return {
                    "success": True,
                    "message": f"File '{filename}' uploaded successfully",
                    "file_id": json_response.get('id')
                }
            except json.JSONDecodeError:
                # Handle non-JSON responses
                return {
                    "success": True,
                    "message": f"File '{filename}' uploaded successfully",
                    "file_id": None
                }
```

### 2. **Improve Success Reporting**
```python
# In process_webhook_payload method
if uploaded_files:
    success_rate = len(uploaded_files) / len(downloaded_files)
    if success_rate < 1.0:
        return {
            "success": True,
            "partial_success": True,
            "message": f"Employee created with {len(uploaded_files)}/{len(downloaded_files)} files uploaded",
            # ... rest of response
        }
```

### 3. **Add Retry Logic**
```python
def upload_file_with_retry(self, employee_id, file_path, filename, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        result = self.upload_file_to_bamboohr(employee_id, file_path, filename)
        if result['success']:
            return result
        time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
    return result
```

### 4. **Add Configuration for Test Mode**
```python
# In __init__ method
self.test_mode = config.get('TEST_MODE', 'true').lower() == 'true'

# In build_employee_payload method
if self.test_mode:
    employee['firstName'] = f"TEST_{candidate.get('first_name')}"
    employee['workEmail'] = test_email
else:
    employee['firstName'] = candidate.get('first_name')
    employee['workEmail'] = candidate.get('email')
```

### 5. **Better Logging**
- Log API responses for debugging
- Add timestamps to all log messages
- Save failed upload details for manual retry

## Test Scenarios to Add

1. **Duplicate Employee Detection**
   - Check if employee already exists before creation
   - Handle duplicate email addresses

2. **Partial Success Handling**
   - Test with some files succeeding and others failing
   - Implement proper partial success reporting

3. **API Rate Limiting**
   - Handle rate limit errors gracefully
   - Implement backoff strategies

4. **File Size Limits**
   - Test with large files
   - Add file size validation before upload

5. **Network Interruption Recovery**
   - Handle network timeouts
   - Implement resume capability for file uploads

## Conclusion

The integration successfully creates employees in BambooHR but fails to upload any documents. This creates incomplete employee records and gives a false impression of success. The main priority should be fixing the file upload functionality and improving error handling to provide accurate feedback about partial failures.
