# TeamTailor JSON Parsing Fix

## Issue
TeamTailor API responses come as **stringified JSON** in the `data` field, not as parsed objects. This requires an additional parsing step.

## Solution
Added JSON parse nodes after each TeamTailor API call to properly handle the responses.

## Implementation

### Pattern Used
```javascript
// Parse TeamTailor response
const items = $input.all();
const parsedItems = items.map((item) => {
  const parsedData = JSON.parse(item?.json?.data || '{}');
  return { json: parsedData };
});
return parsedItems;
```

### Nodes Added
1. **Parse Job Offer** - After "Fetch Job Offer (Filtered)"
2. **Parse Requisition** - After "Fetch Job Requisition"  
3. **Parse Department** - After "Fetch Department"

## Data Flow

```
Before (BROKEN):
API Response → { json: { data: "[{\"type\":\"job-offers\"...}]" } } → Merge (can't read string)

After (FIXED):
API Response → { json: { data: "[{\"type\":\"job-offers\"...}]" } } → Parse → { json: { type: "job-offers"... } } → Merge
```

## Updated Connections

The workflow now has proper parsing at each step:

```
TeamTailor API → Parse JSON → Process Data
```

This ensures:
- ✅ Proper data structure for downstream nodes
- ✅ No "undefined" errors when accessing object properties
- ✅ Clean data merging in the parallel merge node

## Testing

The Python test script (`test_parallel_workflow.py`) has also been updated to handle JSON parsing:

```python
# Parse TeamTailor response correctly
response_text = await response.text()
data = json.loads(response_text)
```

## Impact

This fix ensures the workflow correctly processes TeamTailor webhook data and creates employees in BambooHR with all the proper field mappings.
